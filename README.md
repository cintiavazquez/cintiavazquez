# Hi, I'm 30-year-old translator exploring around 🪐

A few things I like to do in my free time:

- Finding cats to pet  🔍🐈  
- Drawing and painting 🎨 
- Browsing Pinterest
- Trying out new things (such as coding, or woodworking, or archery, or pottery, or or or... 😬)

## Currently very slowly following a Udemy course on vanilla web projects 🐌
